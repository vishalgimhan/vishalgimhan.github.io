<p>Here are some certifications that I've completed and what I learned from them:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Intro to Federated Learning</strong> - Flower Labs
    <p>Build and fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data using a federated learning framework for better privacy"

      Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach where model training happens locally on devices or data sources, keeping the data private. Instead of gathering all data centrally, the training is done where the data resides.
      
      Key Concepts:
      - Public vs Private Data: Public data is limited and biased, while private data is valuable but needs to stay local for privacy reasons.
      - Google Gboard Example: FL is used on devices to improve typing predictions without sending raw data to central servers.
      
      Federated Learning Process:
      1. Initialization: The global model is shared with local devices (clients).
      2. Client Training: Clients train the model locally and send updates back.
      3. Model Aggregation: The server aggregates these updates to improve the global model.
      4. Convergence: The process repeats until the model improves sufficiently.
      
      Tuning Factors:
      - Client selection, configuration, result aggregation, and evaluation are key for effective FL.
      
      Privacy & Security:
      FL enhances privacy but is vulnerable to attacks like membership inference and reconstruction attacks. Differential Privacy (DP) techniques, such as clipping and noising, add layers of protection to ensure sensitive data isn't exposed.
      
      Bandwidth Optimization:
      To reduce bandwidth, techniques like sparsification, quantization, and communicating less frequently (e.g., by pre-training) help make FL more efficient.
      
      In short, federated learning balances privacy with effective model training by keeping data local and improving communication efficiency.</p>
